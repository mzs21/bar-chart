# Here's the fact: 

For an unknown error, I can't show the bar properly at [ https://mzs21.github.io/bar-chart/](https://mzs21.github.io/bar-chart/). 

I tried to solve this but couldn't find any exact solution.

## The error:
The bar chart is working fine on localhost but after hosting on git page it's not showing properly
