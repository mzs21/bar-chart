# Here's the fact: 

For an unknown error, I can't show the bar properly at [ https://mzs21.github.io/bar-chart/](https://mzs21.github.io/bar-chart/). 

I tried to solve this but couldn't find any exact solution.

## The error:
The bar chart is working fine in localhost but after hosting on git page it's not showing properly

I've also opened a issue [here](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/8360). Please help me out if you can.

I know there's no color but let me show you the what it likes in localhost:
